#summary What's new in dao 0.7.0?
#labels Phase-Implementation

* Release date:  2011-10-25

* the code is rewriten completely by the improved techinque which is used by Yield Prolog (http://yieldprolog.sourceforge.net). Yield statement is used to implement unify and backctracking of logic engine, besides, all continuations become functions, by remove class definition. So dao have a great speed up in its run now, and I believe that it can be used in real project. 

* A language dinpy that uses dao's solver as the core is implemented. Dinpy is embedded in python, and dinpy have the features that both lisp and prolog provided.

* Some documents about dao and dinpy are written.
